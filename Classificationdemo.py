2 - Logistic Regression
In this part of the exercise, you will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted 
into a university.


2.1 Problem Statement
Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant‚Äôs chance of
 admission based on their results on two exams.

You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression.
For each training example, you have the applicant‚Äôs scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
Your task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant‚Äôs probability of admission based on the scores 
from those two exams.

2.2 Loading and visualizing the data
You will start by loading the dataset for this task.

The load_dataset() function shown below loads the data into variables X_train and y_train
X_train contains exam scores on two exams for a student
y_train is the admission decision
y_train = 1 if the student was admitted
y_train = 0 if the student was not admitted
Both X_train and y_train are numpy arrays.
*/
'''
# load dataset
X_train, y_train = load_data("data/ex2data1.txt")
'''
View the variables¬∂
Let's get more familiar with your dataset.

A good place to start is to just print out each variable and see what it contains.
The code below prints the first five values of X_train and the type of the variable.
'''
print("First five elements in X_train are:\n", X_train[:5])
print("Type of X_train:",type(X_train))

print("First five elements in y_train are:\n", y_train[:5])
print("Type of y_train:",type(y_train))
'''
Check the dimensions of your variables
Another useful way to get familiar with your data is to view its dimensions. Let's print the shape of X_train and 
y_train and see how many training examples we have in our dataset.
'''
print ('The shape of X_train is: ' + str(X_train.shape))
print ('The shape of y_train is: ' + str(y_train.shape))
print ('We have m = %d training examples' % (len(y_train)))

# Plot examples

# Set the x-axis label

2.6 Learning parameters using gradient descent
Similar to the previous assignment, you will now find the optimal parameters of a logistic regression model by using gradient descent.

You don't need to implement anything for this part. Simply run the cells below.

A good way to verify that gradient descent is working correctly is to look at the value of  ùêΩ(ùê∞,ùëè)
  and check that it is decreasing with each step.

Assuming you have implemented the gradient and computed the cost correctly, your value of  ùêΩ(ùê∞,ùëè)
  should never increase, and should converge to a steady value by the end of the algorithm.
